 1. Explain why a developer, 
who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages,
would normally use a high-level language when writing programs? * 

A high-level programming language is characterized by expressing algorithms in a 
way appropriate to human cognitive capacity, instead of the capacity with which machines run. 

These languages ​​allow the programmer maximum flexibility 
when it comes to abstracting or being literal.

 2. What is machine code?

Machine code. It is the only one that directly understands the computer, 
uses the binary alphabet that consists of the only two symbols 0 and 1, 
called bits (English abbreviation for binary digits). 
It was the first language used in computer programming,
 but it stopped being used due to its difficulty and complexity, 
being replaced by other languages ​​easier to learn and use, which also reduce the possibility of making mistakes.

 3.  Give an example of a high-level language? 
 C++
 It was designed in the mid-1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup. 
 It encompasses two paradigms of programming: structured and object-oriented.

 Fortan 
 It was developed in the 1950s and has been in active use ever since. 
 Acronym for formula translator, Fortran is used primarily in scientific applications and numerical analysis.

 Java
 An object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. 
 Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode, 
 although compilation to native machine code is also possible.
 
 Perl 
 The practical language for extraction and reporting is this programming language designed by Larry Wall in 1987. 
 Perl takes characteristics from C, shell sh interpreted language, AWK, sed, Lisp and, 
 to a lesser extent, from many other programming languages.
 
 PHP 
 It is frequently used for creating website content with which HTML pages and source codes can be programmed. 
 PHP is an acronym that stands for PHP hypertext pre-processor (initially, PHP tools or personal home page tools), 
 and it is an interpreted language that is used to create applications for servers or dynamic website content.
 Lately it is also used to create other types of programs that include applications with a graphical interface, 
 Qt or GTK + libraries.
 
 Python 
 It was made by Guido van Rossum in 1990. Today it is developed as an open source project managed 
 by the Python Software Foundation. 
 The last stable version of the language is 2.5 (September 2006).

# Gold - Answer the following questions

  1.  Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?
 
##   Low-level languages
   They are languages ​​totally dependent on the machine, that is, 
   the program that is made with this type of language cannot be migrated or used on other machines.
 
   Being practically custom designed for the hardware, 
   they take full advantage of the characteristics of the hardware.

##   High-level languages 
   They are those that are closer to natural language than to machine language.
   They are aimed at solving problems through the use of EDD's.
   (EDD's son las abreviaturas de Estructuras Dinamicas de Datos, 
   algo muy utilizado en todos los lenguajes de programación.)
 
   A program written in a high-level language, you can migrate it from one machine to another without any problem.
 
   They allow the programmer to completely forget about the internal workings of the machine (s) 
   for which they are designing the program.

  2.  What does a translator do?
 
  A translator is a programming language processor that converts a computer program from one language to another. 
  It takes a program written in source code and converts it into machine code. 
  It discovers and identifies the error during translation.
 
  3.  Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?

   2.- Assemblers. It is a type of translator that converts programs written in assembly language 
   into programs written in machine code.

   1.- Preprocessors. 
   It translates one high-level language to another, when the first cannot be converted to machine language directly.

#   Platinum - Exam questions

   1. What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?

   Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code. 
   Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once. 
   An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code.

   2.  What is assembly language?

   In computer programming, assembly language (or assembler language), often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language 
   in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in 
   the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

   3.  A developer is writing a program.

   a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. 
   Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code? 
 
   Difference in machine code assembly code and high level languages
   In machine code instructions are in binary code. High-level code is designed to be read by human programmers. 
   Machine code is to be read/executed by the computer High level code can be portable/translated 
   for different machines Machine code is specific to a particular machine. 

#   b) One type of translator is an interpreter.

#   i) Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code?
 
##   An interpreter translates code into machine code, 
   instruction by instruction - the CPU executes each instruction before the interpreter moves on to translate the next instruction. 
   Interpreted code will show an error as soon as it hits a problem, so it is easier to debug than compiled code.

#   ii) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code?

   compilers.
   interpreters.
   assemblers.

##  Compliers 
 
  A compiler is a translator used to convert high-level programming language to low-level programming language. 
  It converts the whole program in one session and reports errors detected after the conversion.

## Interpreters
 
  Just like a compiler, is a translator used to convert high-level programming language to low-level programming language. 
  It converts the program one at a time and reports errors detected at once, while doing the conversion.

## Assemblers 

  An assembler is is a translator used to translate assembly language to machine language.
  It is like a compiler for the assembly language but interactive like an interpreter.
